# Workout Application User Interface<br><br>
It is a simple Workout Application Interface which has 4 pages built on the Iphone X prototype with dimensions 375 x 812 px.
<br<br>
✔First Page - Workout + Categories. 🏋️‍♂️
✔Second Page - Daily & Monthly Steps. 🚶‍♂️
✔Third Page - AI Jumping Rope + Activities. 🤸‍♀️
✔Fourth Page - Cumulative Stats + Achievements 🎖.

I chose to utilize only 2 colours to keep it simple and elegant.
